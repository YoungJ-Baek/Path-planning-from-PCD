# Path planning from PCD to the shortest path

Efficient path planning using quadtree from PCD format file. Looking for other data structures for better performance, but now weâ€™re using quadtree.

## Abstract

Path finding program based on Python using A* algorithm on given PCD file.



## Example

```bash
python main.py [PCD file_directory]
```

You can easily use this program by typing cmd above. For better understanding, we provide sample example for our repository below.

```bash
python main.py data/ldso_kitti00_map_inliners.pcd
```



## To-do

1. Modify to be able to set up start, end point with arguments(now, configuration file)
2. Eliminate unnecessary parts of other modules
